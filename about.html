    <h3>
        Who is Claude?
    </h3>

    <p>I am a young a passionate designer, I have been interested in arts and design from a young age.
        I started off as a beginner in filming with phones and digital cameras that I could find from friends
        and relatives. From there I got into editing my own pictures with various software available on android at the
        time.
        I did this for fun, but it started getting bigger when I actually was hired in a starting-off agency.
        I didn't much responsibility in the agency I was in the printing part of the service we offered.
        But from there I got to use professional software for personal purposes as I was allowed access to the devices
        we had.

        <h3>
            My Academic Journey
        </h3>

        <p>When I came to Cape Town for studies, I was accepted in the Information Technology field.
            From there I got the opportunity to explore the multimedia field from an academic perspective;
            I have worked on various projects from the beginning of the year, academic projects and personal projects.
            I always try to convey meaning through my work and my portfolio displays how I achieve it through my
            creation.
